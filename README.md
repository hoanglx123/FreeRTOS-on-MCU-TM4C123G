# FreeRTOS-on-MCU-TM4C123G

# 1. Introduce
  The project is based on TI FreeRTOS. It is created with main purpose to study the operation of FreeRTOS on MCU. Please refer the project for studying and improve programming skill. Don't use it for commercial products.

# 3. Toolchains 
- GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain: https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
- TivaWareâ„¢ for C Series: http://software-dl.ti.com/tiva-c/SW-TM4C/latest/index_FDS.html
- Flash programmer: https://github.com/utzig/lm4tools

# 4. How to compile 
Modify the path of toolchain mentioned in Config.mk. Then, run Make to build project. In addition, I only run on Ubuntu and Bash in Window 10, so I don't sure it runs smoothly on other platform.
